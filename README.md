Title: "Single-cell RNA analysis reveals differences in gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between COVID-19 infected individuals and healthy controls"

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. While much research has focused on understanding the mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, a growing body of evidence suggests that the host immune response also plays a critical role in disease severity and progression.

One approach to studying the immune response to COVID-19 is to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which are important components of the immune system. PBMCs include various immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, which work together to protect the body against infections. It is important to identify and understand the differences in gene expression profiles between individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 and healthy individuals. Specifically, the study aims to analyze the gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at the single-cell level, which can help to identify specific cell types that are affected by COVID-19 and reveal the underlying mechanisms of the disease. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of PBMCs, the researchers can identify the specific genes that are upregulated or downregulated in response to COVID-19 infection. This can provide valuable insights into the immune response to the virus and help to identify potential therapeutic targets for the disease.

The study's research data had already been published, and the main objective of this paper is to showcase my proficiency in conducting step-by-step scRNA analysis in R using Seurat and tidyverse packages, rather than delving extensively into the study itself. Access to the primary information regarding this study can be found on the NCBI's GEO website under accession number GSE150728, which contains scRNA RAW data from 7 COVID-19 patients and 6 healthy controls.
